## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Garrett Weaver and I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Dayton. I have a strong background in Java, with experience in Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and SQL. I also have significant cloud experience from my time at the J.M. Smucker Company and from passing the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam](https://cp.certmetrics.com/amazon/en/public/verify/credential/b85f8698f4bb41fe811cdb78e10f9176).
